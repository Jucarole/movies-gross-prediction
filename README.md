# movies-gross-prediction
On this project I'm using different regression models to predict the "worldwide_gross" of any movie in the dataset and then choose wich is the best.
Before starting to predict, I did a cleanup of the data and filled in the missing information. The name of the new dataset is "clean_movies.csv".
